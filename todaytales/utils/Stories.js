    story:[`Atrangi Re hit the screens this weekend and we were predictably floored by Dhanush's performance. 
    The film marked his homecoming, as the actor mentioned in Koffee with Karan, and what a comeback it was. 
    However, the actor, often viewed as one of the best in the Indian film industry, has hardly ever missed the mark. 
    Here's a look back at the films wherein Dhanush proved his acting prowess.`,
    `**1. Asuran**|

    The socio-political film by Vetri Maaran could easily be counted as one of the best projects Dhanush has been part of. 
    He slips into a deglamorized avatar to bring forth Sivasamy, a doting father and a saviour of the oppressed. 
    The actor delivers a performance as powerful as the script. And bagged several awards, 
    including the National Award for Best Actor for the film.`]
